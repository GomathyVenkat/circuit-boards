Circuit Board Building
======================

The [L.I.D.](http://pdx.edu/interconnected) had the ablity to let students build
high quility prototype two layer circuit boards in a short amount of time. We
have two PCB routers to accomplish this task:

### [LPKF s63](LPKF)

### [AccruateCNC A406](A406)

and a electroplating tank for plating Vias:

### [LPKF MiniContac RS](Electroplating_Tank)

# Make A Board Using Eagle

If you are using Eagle to make a board, use our handy CAM and DRU files to
check your board before you route, and to make gerbers.

### [Download Zip File](https://github.com/psu-epl/circuit-boards/archive/master.zip)

Inside the zip there is a folder called `eagle`. That has the cam and dru files
for this lab.
